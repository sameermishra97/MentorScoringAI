## 🎯 Overview

In education, evaluating teaching quality at scale is a major challenge — feedback is often subjective and inconsistent.  
**Mentor Scoring AI** solves this by offering a data-driven, AI-powered assessment framework that can automatically evaluate a mentor’s communication effectiveness, confidence, and engagement from either text or audio input.

The project demonstrates a **functional 60–80% prototype** integrating NLP, sentiment analysis, and readability scoring through a web interface.
